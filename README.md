# hierarchical-clustering
# Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers" of american mall market called PHONIX Mall.To find out on the basics requirements of dendrogram using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no_of linkage of a clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement
The American finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found has hieghest number growth in thier bussiness market.

As the data science engineer find out which hierarcy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.
# Task1: import the libery and datasets
# Task2:Using the dendogram to find the optimal number of clusters
# Task3:Create a hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib
# Project Approch

# Conclusion
According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 as give highest number of linkage.
