# hierarchical-clustering
# Project Title: Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers" of american mall market called PHONIX Mall.To find out on the basics requirements of dendrogram using scipy graphics library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the no_of linkage of a clustering to predict.
# Problem Statement
The American finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found has hieghest number growth in thier bussiness market.

As the data science engineer find out which hierarcy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.
# Task1: import the libery and datasets
# Task2:Using the dendogram to find the optimal number of clusters
# Task3:Create a hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with the help of matplotlib
# Project Approch

# Insights
1)Cluster1 contains(Red) which sjow that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclimimh distance from the centroid upto annual income approximate 139ks

2)Cluster2 contains(blue) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euclding from centroid upto annual income approximatly 79-80ks.

3)Cluster3 contains(green) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 139ks.

4)Cluster4 contains(cyan) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 39-40ks.

5)Cluster5 contains(pink) which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 40-41ks.

# Conclusion
According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 as give highest number of linkage.
